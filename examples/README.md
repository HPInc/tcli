## Overview

When running examples from here, consider the following:
- Keep in mind that you are running these against a shared internet server.
- Example scripts are data driven and will be influenced by the api results at the time.
- Take a moment to read and understand the scripts before you run them.
- For extended testing, use servers that you trust and control.

Clone this project, then from the source root, do `make install` and run `./example/example.sh` to try the
